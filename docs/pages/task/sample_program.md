For example the `getactinf.pgm.rpgle` contains the code to be explained.  

```rpgle
**free
    ctl-opt dftactgrp(*no) actgrp(*new);

    dcl-f AccPf keyed;

    dcl-s TempAccNo like(P_AccNo);

    dcl-pi *n;
       P_UserId char(10) const;
       P_AccNo char(10);
    end-pi;

    TempAccNo = P_AccNo;

    setll *loval AccPf;
    read AccPf;
    dow not %eof(AccPf);
    if CustId = P_UserId;
        P_AccNo = AccNo;
        leave;
    endif;
    read AccPf;
    enddo;

    *inlr = *on;
``` 

This example indicates that the `getactinf.pgm.rpgle` relies on the `accpf.pf` file. If there were additional files like display files or copybooks, they would be included in the context section as well.

Therefore the `context` directory would look like:

```text
 - context
    - accpf.pf 
```

## api_output

### 1. Purpose

The RPGLE program is designed to retrieve the account number (`AccNo`) for a given user ID (`P_UserId`) from the `AccPf` file. It reads through the records in the `AccPf` file and searches for a match with the provided user ID. Once a match is found, it sets the corresponding account number in the output parameter `P_AccNo`.

### 2. Parameters

| |  `Parameter Name`  |   `Type` |  `Direction`  |  `Description`  |
|-|-------------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| 1 |`P_UserId`         | `char(10)`   | Input         | Represents the user ID provided as input to the program. Used to search for the corresponding account number in the `AccPf` file. |
| 2| `P_AccNo`          | `char(10)` | Output        | Represents the account number retrieved from the `AccPf` file. Set by the program as the output. |

### 3. Inputs and Outputs
| File Name       | Type     | Used         | Description                                      |
|-----------------|----------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCPF`      | Data     | Input        | A database file accessed in input mode with keyed access to retrieve account details based on `CustId`.            |

### 4. Limitations
- The program is designed to read data and return the account number but does not provide functionality to update records in the `AccPf` file.

### 5. Usage Example

```clle
dcl &accno type(*char) len(10)  /* Account number */
dcl &userid type(*char) len(10) /* Userid */

chgvar &userid 'TEST01';
call GETACTINF PARM(&userid &accno);
```
-If a matching record is found:  
  The program sets `account_number` to the corresponding account number (e.g., `'9876543210'`).
-If no match is found: 
  - `account_number` is not changed.


## how_output

### 1. High-Level Purpose of the Program
- The RPGLE program is designed to retrieve the account number (`AccNo`) for a given user ID (`P_UserId`) from the `AccPf` file. It reads through the records in the `AccPf` file and searches for a match with the provided user ID. Once a match is found, it sets the corresponding account number in the output parameter `P_AccNo`.

### 2. Control Specifications

Control specifications in RPGLE are used to define the overall behavior and environment settings for the program. 
```rpgle
       ctl-opt dftactgrp(*no) actgrp(*new);
```
  - `dftactgrp(*no)`: Indicates that the program should not run in the default activation group.
  - `actgrp(*new)`: Specifies that the program should run in a new activation group.

### 3. File Specifications

These file specifications define how each file will be accessed and used within the program, ensuring that the necessary operations (input, update, add) can be performed on the files as required.

```rpgle
       dcl-f AccPf keyed;
```
  - File Type: Physical file `ACCPF` declared.
  - Attributes:
    - `keyed`: Keyed access, meaning the file is accessed using a key field.
    - Keywords assumed by default:
      - `disk`: A database file
      - `usage(*input)`: Used for input only
      - `ext`: Externally described

### 4. Global Components

#### 4.1 Variables

Stand alone variables in RPGLE are used to store data that is not directly associated with a file or data structure. These variables can be used for various purposes, such as holding intermediate values, parameters, and flags.

```rpgle
       dcl-s TempAccNo like(P_AccNo);
```
| Name           | Data Type               | Description                                  |
|----------------|------------------------ |----------------------------------------------|
| `TempAccNo` | `like(P_AccNo)`, `char(10)` | It is not used, but was likely intended to hold the initial value of the `P_AccNo` parameter. |

#### 4.2 Procedure Interface

The procedure interface in RPGLE defines the parameters that are passed to a procedure when it is called.
```rpgle
       dcl-pi *n;
          P_UserId char(10) const;
          P_AccNo char(10);
       end-pi;
```
- `dcl-pi *n`: `*n` is used as a place-holder for the name of the procedure.
- `P_UserId char(10) const`
  - `P_UserId`: The name of the parameter, which represents the user ID.
  - `char(10)`: Specifies that the parameter `P_UserId` is a character variable with a length of 10.
  - `const`: Indicates that the parameter is a constant, meaning its value cannot be changed within the procedure.

- `P_AccNo char(10)`
  - `P_AccNo`: The name of the parameter, which represents the account number.
  - `char(10)`: Specifies that the parameter `P_AccNo` is a character variable with a length of 10.

### 6. Main Line Code
- The program positions the file pointer at the lowest value in the file `AccPf` to prepare for sequential reading from the beginning.
- It enters a loop that continues to execute as long as the end of the file has not been reached. This ensures that all records in the file are processed.
- Inside the loop, the program checks if the `CustId` field from the current record matches the `P_UserId` parameter. If the condition is true, it means the record belongs to the user specified by `P_UserId`.
- When the condition is met, the program assigns the `AccNo` field from the current record to the `P_AccNo` parameter, capturing the account number associated with the user.
- After assigning the account number, the program exits the loop to prevent further reading of records once the desired record is found.
- If the condition is not met, the program reads the next record from the file `AccPf` and continues the loop.
- Once the loop finishes (either by finding the record or reaching the end of the file), the program sets the last record indicator to `on`, indicating the end of the program and ensuring proper cleanup.

### 7. Possible Problems with this Code
- If the same program runs again without resetting `P_AccNo`, it retains the previous value, leading to incorrect or unintended output. This can happen in interactive or looped calls if the variable is not reinitialized.
- The program does not check whether `P_UserId` is blank. If `P_UserId` is blank, the program will still attempt to find a matching record and may return an unintended account number.
- The program reads through the entire `AccPf` file until it finds a match or reaches the end of the file. This can be inefficient for large files.

### 8. Possible Improvements to this Code
- Ensure `P_AccNo` is initialized to an empty value at the start of the procedure to provide consistent results for the caller.
- Add validation to check if `P_UserId` is blank before processing the file. This ensures that the program does not attempt to find a match for an empty user ID, which could lead to unintended results.
- Implement error handling to manage cases where no matching record is found. This could involve returning a specific value or message indicating that no match was found, improving the program's robustness and user feedback.
- Use a keyed read operation instead of reading through the entire file to improve performance. This approach directly accesses the record with the matching key, reducing the time complexity from linear to constant time for the lookup.


## sum_output

### Summary 
The program is designed to retrieve the account number (`P_AccNo`) associated with a given user ID (`P_UserId`) from a file (`AccPf`). It iterates through the records in the file, checking each record to find a match for the user ID. Once a match is found, the corresponding account number is assigned to `P_AccNo` and returned.

Since the example is fairly small and straightforward, the difficult is 2 out of 5
The RPG language variant is fully free RPG IV.
The source is for a program with no MAIN keyword so it can participate in an RPG cycle.
This particular example is chosen for evaluating the model rather than testing it.
