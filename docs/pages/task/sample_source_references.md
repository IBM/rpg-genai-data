For example the `getactinf.pgm.rpgle` contains the code. 
```rpgle
**free
ctl-opt dftactgrp(-no) actgrp(-new);

dcl-f AccPf if e k disk;

dcl-s P_UserId char(10);

dcl-pi -n;
  P_UserId char(10) const;
  P_AccNo  char(10);
end-pi;

// Main program logic
P_AccNo = GetAccNo(P_UserId);

*inlr = -on;

// Subprocedure to get account number
dcl-proc GetAccNo;
  dcl-pi GetAccNo char(10);
    P_UserId char(10) const;
  end-pi;

  dcl-s FoundAccNo char(10);  

  setll -loval AccPf;
  read AccPf;
  dow not %eof(AccPf);
    if CustId = P_UserId;
      FoundAccNo = AccNo;  
      leave;
    endif;
    read AccPf;
  enddo;

  return FoundAccNo;
end-proc;
```  

For example the `GetAccNo` procedure contains the following code to be explained.

```rpgle
dcl-proc GetAccNo;
  dcl-pi GetAccNo char(10);
    P_UserId char(10) const;
  end-pi;

  dcl-s FoundAccNo char(10);  

  setll -loval AccPf;
  read AccPf;
  dow not %eof(AccPf);
    if CustId = P_UserId;
      FoundAccNo = AccNo;  
      leave;
    endif;
    read AccPf;
  enddo;

  return FoundAccNo;
end-proc;
```  

Input and Context folder are not required for procedure or subroutine.  This is because the `source`, `start` and `end` attributes will define exactly which source and context is referenced.

## api_output

### 1. Purpose

The subprocedure `GetAccNo` is responsible for retrieving the account number (`AccNo`) associated with a given user ID (`P_UserId`) from the `AccPf` physical file. It scans through the file records and returns the `AccNo` of the first record where the `CustId` matches the input `P_UserId`. If no matching record is found, it returns a blank value.

### 2. Parameters

| Parameter Name              | Type   | Length | Direction | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `P_UserId`                  | `char` | 10     | Input     | The user ID passed to the subprocedure. It is compared with the `CustId` field in the `AccPf` file to find a matching record.                                                                                                                                  |

### 3. Return Value

| Return Name | Type   | Length | Direction | Description                                                                                                  |
|-------------|--------|--------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GetAccNo`  | `char` | 10     | Output    | Returns the account number (`AccNo`) from `AccPf` if a matching `CustId` is found. otherwise, returns blank. |

### 4. Inputs/Outputs
  - Inputs : `AccPf` â€“ A physical file used to read account records.
  - Outputs: No data is written to any file.

### 5. Side Effects
- NA

### 6. Limitations

- The procedure performs a linear read and stops at the first match only.
- It does not handle duplicate `CustId` entries (returns the first match only).
- If the required fields are missing in the `AccPf` file or improperly mapped, the procedure may return incorrect data or fail.

#### 7.Usage Example

```rpgle
dcl-s userid char(10);
dcl-s account_number char(10);

userid = 'TEST01';
account_number = GetAccno(userid);
```

- If a matching record is found:
  The subprocedure will return the corresponding `AccNo` (e.g., `'9876543210'`), and `account_number` will be set to this value.

- If no match is found:
  - On the first run: `account_number` will remain blank and will be returned as such.
  - If called again without reinitializing `account_number`, it will still return a blank value unless the record is found.


## how_output

### 1. High-Level Purpose of the Program
The subprocedure `GetAccNo` is responsible for retrieving the account number (`AccNo`) associated with a given user ID (`P_UserId`) from the `AccPf` physical file. It scans through the file records and returns the `AccNo` of the first record where the `CustId` matches the input `P_UserId`. If no matching record is found, it returns a blank value.

### 2. Global Components

#### 2.1 Procedure Interface
The procedure interface defines the input parameters for a procedure. It allows data to be passed into the procedure when it is called, and specifies how the parameters are declared and used within the procedure.

- `dcl-pi GetAccNo char(10)`
  - `GetAccNo`: The name of the procedure being defined.
  - Attributes:
    - `dcl-pi`: Declares the procedure interface.
    - `char(10)`: Specifies that the return type of the procedure is a character variable with a length of 10 characters.
  - Purpose: The return type indicates that the procedure returns an account number (`char(10)`).

- `P_UserId char(10) const`
  - `P_UserId`: This is the input parameter representing the user ID for which the account number is being searched.
  - Attributes:
    - `char(10)`: Specifies that the parameter is a character variable with a length of 10.
    - `const`: Indicates that the value of this parameter is constant and cannot be modified within the procedure.
  - Purpose: The `P_UserId` holds the user ID passed to the procedure. It is used to compare against the `CustId` field in the file records to locate the corresponding account number.

#### 2.2 Stand-Alone Variables (Local Variables)
Local variables are used to hold intermediate values or results that are needed during the execution of a procedure. These are variables declared within the procedure and are only accessible inside that procedure.

- `dcl-s FoundAccNo char(10)`

  - `FoundAccNo`: A character variable with a length of 10.
  - Attributes:
    - `dcl-s`: Declares a stand-alone (local) variable.
    - `char(10)`: Specifies that the variable is alphanumeric with a length of 10 characters.
  - Purpose: This variable is used to store the account number (`AccNo`) when a matching `CustId` is found. If a match is found, it holds the account number to be returned; otherwise, it is returned as blank.

### 3. Main Line Code
- The program positions the file pointer at the lowest value in the file `AccPf` to prepare for sequential reading from the beginning.
- It enters a loop that continues to execute as long as the end of the file has not been reached. This ensures that all records in the file are processed.
- Inside the loop, the program checks if the `CustId` field from the current record matches the `P_UserId` parameter. If the condition is true, it means the record belongs to the user specified by `P_UserId`.
- When the condition is met, the program assigns the `AccNo` field from the current record to the local variable `FoundAccNo`, capturing the account number associated with the user.
- After assigning the account number, the program exits the loop using the `leave` statement to prevent further reading of records once the desired record is found.
- If the condition is not met, the program reads the next record from the file `AccPf` and continues the loop.
- Once the loop finishes (either by finding the record or reaching the end of the file), the program returns the value of `FoundAccNo`, which holds the account number if found, or an empty value if no match was found.

### 4. Possible Problems with this Code
- If the program is called multiple times without resetting `FoundAccNo`, it may retain the previous value, leading to incorrect or unintended output. This issue arises if the `FoundAccNo` variable is not reinitialized between calls, especially in cases of interactive or looped invocations.
- The program does not validate whether `P_UserId` is blank. If `P_UserId` is blank, the program will attempt to find a matching record in the `AccPf` file, potentially returning an unintended or incorrect account number for a blank user ID.
- The program reads the `AccPf` file sequentially until it finds a matching record or reaches the end. This can be inefficient for large files, as it may need to process a large number of records before finding the desired match. This could lead to performance issues in scenarios where the file is large and only a small percentage of records match the query.

### 5. Possible Improvements to this Code
- Ensure `FoundAccNo` is initialized to an empty value (`-BLANK`) at the start of the procedure to avoid retaining the previous value. This prevents unintended outputs when the procedure is called multiple times or in scenarios where `FoundAccNo` is used in further logic.
- Add validation to check if `P_UserId` is blank before processing the file. This will prevent the program from attempting to find a match for an empty user ID, which could lead to incorrect results or unnecessary file reads.
- Implement error handling for cases where no matching record is found. Instead of silently returning an empty or incorrect account number, consider returning a specific value (e.g., `-BLANK` or a predefined error code) or providing an error message indicating no match was found. This improves the program's robustness and provides clear feedback to the user.
- Replace the sequential read loop with a more efficient keyed read operation, assuming the `AccPf` file is keyed by `CustId`. By using `setll` and `read (keyed)` operations, the program can directly access the record with the matching `CustId`, reducing the time complexity from O(n) (linear search) to O(1) (constant time) for lookups. This improves performance, particularly for larger files.


## sum_output

### Summary
The program is designed to retrieve the account number (`FoundAccNo`) associated with a given user ID (`P_UserId`) from the file (`AccPf`). It sequentially reads through the records in the file, checking each record to see if the `CustId` matches the provided `P_UserId`. Once a match is found, the corresponding account number (`AccNo`) is assigned to `FoundAccNo` and returned.
