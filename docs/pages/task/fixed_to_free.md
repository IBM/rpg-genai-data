# Convert Fixed Format RPG to Fully Free RPG

This is not something we expect to use the AI for as there are excellent deterministic tools to do so.  But we feel that this is an excellent way to train the AI.

## Format

* fixed-to-free
  * {unique contributor id}
    * attribution.txt
    * {unique test id}
      * i1_input.rpgle - Old fixed format RPG
      * output.rpgle - New free format RPG
      * metadata.md - difficulty, language, task

Full description of all the metadata variants can be found [here](/pages/metadata.md).
