# Format of attribution.txt file

An important part of contributing to the RPG AI project is citing your sources of information. This comes in the form of your `attribution.txt` that you add to the pull requests. Almost all instances of attribution can be covered by the parameters required for Creative Commons Attribution licenses. Some parameters are as follows:

```text
title : - Title of work
contact : - name of contact who contributed the work and can validate its origin
email : - contact info of contact
organization : - optional name of organization that owns the original work
license : - permissive license type
link - - optional link to the original work
version : - version - if possible git tag or commit, but if not anything recognizable by the contact
```
