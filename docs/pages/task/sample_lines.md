# Sample Select Lines Explanations

For example the `getactinf.pgm.rpgle` contains the code:   

```rpgle
    **free
    ctl-opt dftactgrp(*no) actgrp(*new);

    dcl-f AccPf if e k disk;

    dcl-s P_UserId char(10);

    dcl-pi *n;
    P_UserId char(10) const;
    P_AccNo char(10);
    end-pi;

    setll *loval AccPf;
    read AccPf;
    dow not %eof(AccPf);
    if CustId = P_UserId;
        P_AccNo = AccNo;
        leave;
    endif;
    read AccPf;
    enddo;

    *inlr = *on;
``` 

For example below following `lines` to be explained.

```rpgle
   setll -loval AccPf;
    read AccPf;
    dow not %eof(AccPf);
    if CustId = P_UserId;
        P_AccNo = AccNo;
        leave;
    endif;
    read AccPf;
    enddo;
```

### 1. Purpose

This logic performs a sequential search in the `AccPf` file to find a customer record where the `CustId` matches the input parameter `P_UserId`. Once a match is found, the corresponding account number (`AccNo`) is assigned to the output parameter `P_AccNo`, and the search is terminated. This allows the program to retrieve a specific user's account number based on their customer ID.

### 2. Main Logic
- The file pointer is positioned to the start of the `AccPf` file using `SETLL -LOVAL AccPf`, ensuring the file is read from the lowest key onward.
- The first record is read from the file with `READ AccPf`.
- A loop is started using `DOW NOT %EOF(AccPf)`, which continues until all records are processed.
- Inside the loop:

  - It checks if the `CustId` in the current record matches the input parameter `P_UserId`.
  - If a match is found:

    - The `AccNo` from the current record is assigned to the output parameter `P_AccNo`.
    - The loop is exited immediately using `LEAVE`, since the target record has been found.
  - If no match is found, the next record is read using `READ AccPf`, and the loop continues.
- The loop ends when a match is found and the loop exits, or the end of file is reached without finding a match.

### 3. Possible Problems:

- The `P_AccNo` variable should be properly initialized before the loop starts. If it’s not initialized, it might carry over an old value from previous iterations, causing incorrect results when searching for a new account number.
- The code doesn't check if `P_UserId` is valid or non-blank before attempting to find a match in the file. If `P_UserId` is empty or incorrect, the program will still try to read records from `AccPf`, which could result in unnecessary operations or incorrect results.
- If there is no matching `CustId` in the file, the loop will finish, and `P_AccNo` will remain unchanged. There is no way for the calling program to know that no match was found. It would be better to provide some form of indication (e.g., setting `P_AccNo` to a default value or returning a specific error code).

### 4. Possible Improvements:
-  Before entering the loop, initialize `P_AccNo` to a default value or empty string to ensure it does not hold any stale values from previous iterations.
- Add a validation step before the loop to ensure that `P_UserId` is valid (e.g., not blank or invalid). This would prevent unnecessary processing if the input is invalid.
- After the loop, check if `P_AccNo` was updated. If it wasn’t (i.e., no matching `CustId` was found), set `P_AccNo` to a default value or return a specific error code indicating that the account was not found.
-  If `AccPf` is keyed on `CustId`, use `read(e)` instead of `read`. This would allow the program to directly find the record for the given `CustId`, rather than reading all records sequentially, improving performance.

### Summary

This logic performs a sequential search in the `AccPf` file to find a customer record where the `CustId` matches the input parameter `P_UserId`. Once a match is found, the corresponding account number (`AccNo`) is assigned to the output parameter `P_AccNo`, and the search is terminated. This allows the program to retrieve a specific user's account number based on their customer ID.
