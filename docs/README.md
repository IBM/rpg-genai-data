# Training RPG Generative AI

IBM would like to train generative AI models to understand RPG and IBM i application development.
We recognize that many customers have valuable assets and expertise and we want to collaborate on building an AI that will help us all.

## How to contribute

We would prefer contributing actual question and answer pairs to train the AI following [these instructions](pages/how_to_contribute_to_AI_training)

It will also be useful to contribute RPG source code following [these instructions](pages/send_RPG_code)

In either case, contributing to the IBM git repository for this data should follow [this process](pages/pull_request)
