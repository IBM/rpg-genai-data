For example the `getactinf.pgm.rpgle` contains the code. 
```rpgle
**free
ctl-opt dftactgrp(-no) actgrp(-new);

dcl-f AccPf if e k disk;

dcl-s P_UserId char(10);

dcl-pi -n;
  P_UserId char(10) const;
  P_AccNo  char(10);
end-pi;

// Main program logic
P_AccNo = GetAccNo(P_UserId);

*inlr = -on;

// Subprocedure to get account number
dcl-proc GetAccNo;
  dcl-pi GetAccNo char(10);
    P_UserId char(10) const;
  end-pi;

  dcl-s FoundAccNo char(10);  

  setll -loval AccPf;
  read AccPf;
  dow not %eof(AccPf);
    if CustId = P_UserId;
      FoundAccNo = AccNo;  
      leave;
    endif;
    read AccPf;
  enddo;

  return FoundAccNo;
end-proc;
```  

For example the `GetAccNo` procedure contains the following code to be explained.

```rpgle
       dcl-proc GetAccNo;
         dcl-pi GetAccNo char(10);
            P_UserId char(10) const;
         end-pi;

         dcl-s FoundAccNo char(10);  

         setll -loval AccPf;
         read AccPf;
         dow not %eof(AccPf);
           if CustId = P_UserId;
             FoundAccNo = AccNo;  
             leave;
           endif;
           read AccPf;
         enddo;

         return FoundAccNo;
       end-proc;
```  

Input and Context folder are not required for procedure or subroutine.  This is because the `source`, `start` and `end` attributes will define exactly which source and context is referenced.

## api_output

### 1. Purpose

The `GetAccNo` procedure retrieves the account number (`AccNo`) associated with a given user ID (`P_UserId`) from the `AccPf` physical file. It scans the file and returns the `AccNo` of the first record where `CustId` matches the input `P_UserId`. If no match is found, it returns a blank value.

### 2. Parameters

|   | Name        | Usage | Data Type  | Description                                         | Attributes |
|---|-------------|-------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1 | `P_UserId`  | Input | char(10)   | The user ID to search for in the `AccPf` file.      | CONST      |

### 3. Return Value

| Data Type | Description                                              |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| char(10)  | Returns the account number (`AccNo`) if a match is found; otherwise, returns blank. |

### 4. Inputs and Outputs

#### Global variables used

_None._

#### File I/O

| File Name | Type | Used  | Description                                      |
|-----------|------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `AccPf`   | Data | Input | Reads account records to find a matching user ID |

### 5. Dependencies

_None. The procedure does not call external programs, service programs, data areas, data queues, or message files._

### 6. Limitations & Assumptions
- The procedure performs a linear read and stops at the first match only.
- It does not handle duplicate `CustId` entries (returns the first match only).
- If the required fields are missing in the `AccPf` file or improperly mapped, the procedure may return incorrect data or fail.

### 7. Usage Example

```rpgle
   dcl-s userid char(10);
   dcl-s account_number char(10);

   userid = 'TEST01';
   account_number = GetAccNo(userid);

   // account_number now contains the account number for 'TEST01', or blank if not found
```
## how_output

### 1. High-Level Purpose of the Program
The subprocedure `GetAccNo` is responsible for retrieving the account number (`AccNo`) associated with a given user ID (`P_UserId`) from the `AccPf` physical file. It scans through the file records and returns the `AccNo` of the first record where the `CustId` matches the input `P_UserId`. If no matching record is found, it returns a blank value.

|---|-------------|-------|------------|------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1 | `P_UserId`  | Input | char(10)   | The user ID to search for in the `AccPf` file. | CONST      |

#### 2.2 Return Value

| Data Type | Description                                              |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| char(10)  | Returns the account number (`AccNo`) if a match is found. otherwise, returns blank. |

#### 2.2 Stand-Alone Variables (Local Variables)

| Name         | Data Type | Description                                   | Attributes |
|--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|------------|
| `FoundAccNo` | char(10)  | Stores the account number if a match is found |            |

### 3. Main Line Code
- The program positions the file pointer at the lowest value in the file `AccPf` to prepare for sequential reading from the beginning.
- It enters a loop that continues to execute as long as the end of the file has not been reached. This ensures that all records in the file are processed.
- Inside the loop, the program checks if the `CustId` field from the current record matches the `P_UserId` parameter. If the condition is true, it means the record belongs to the user specified by `P_UserId`.
- When the condition is met, the program assigns the `AccNo` field from the current record to the local variable `FoundAccNo`, capturing the account number associated with the user.
- After assigning the account number, the program exits the loop using the `leave` statement to prevent further reading of records once the desired record is found.
- If the condition is not met, the program reads the next record from the file `AccPf` and continues the loop.
- Once the loop finishes (either by finding the record or reaching the end of the file), the program returns the value of `FoundAccNo`, which holds the account number if found, or an empty value if no match was found.

### 4. Possible Problems with this Code
- If the program is called multiple times without resetting `FoundAccNo`, it may retain the previous value, leading to incorrect or unintended output. This issue arises if the `FoundAccNo` variable is not reinitialized between calls, especially in cases of interactive or looped invocations.
- The program does not validate whether `P_UserId` is blank. If `P_UserId` is blank, the program will attempt to find a matching record in the `AccPf` file, potentially returning an unintended or incorrect account number for a blank user ID.
- The program reads the `AccPf` file sequentially until it finds a matching record or reaches the end. This can be inefficient for large files, as it may need to process a large number of records before finding the desired match. This could lead to performance issues in scenarios where the file is large and only a small percentage of records match the query.

### 5. Possible Improvements to this Code
- Ensure `FoundAccNo` is initialized to an empty value (`-BLANK`) at the start of the procedure to avoid retaining the previous value. This prevents unintended outputs when the procedure is called multiple times or in scenarios where `FoundAccNo` is used in further logic.
- Add validation to check if `P_UserId` is blank before processing the file. This will prevent the program from attempting to find a match for an empty user ID, which could lead to incorrect results or unnecessary file reads.
- Implement error handling for cases where no matching record is found. Instead of silently returning an empty or incorrect account number, consider returning a specific value (e.g., `-BLANK` or a predefined error code) or providing an error message indicating no match was found. This improves the program's robustness and provides clear feedback to the user.
- Replace the sequential read loop with a more efficient keyed read operation, assuming the `AccPf` file is keyed by `CustId`. By using `setll` and `read (keyed)` operations, the program can directly access the record with the matching `CustId`, reducing the time complexity from O(n) (linear search) to O(1) (constant time) for lookups. This improves performance, particularly for larger files.


## sum_output

### Summary
The program is designed to retrieve the account number (`FoundAccNo`) associated with a given user ID (`P_UserId`) from the file (`AccPf`). It sequentially reads through the records in the file, checking each record to see if the `CustId` matches the provided `P_UserId`. Once a match is found, the corresponding account number (`AccNo`) is assigned to `FoundAccNo` and returned.
